# Sum of Array Elements

**Problem:** Write a program to find the sum of all elements in a given array.

**Input:** An array of integers.  
Example: [8, 5, 9, 2, 7, 2]

**Output:** Sum of all array elements.  
Example: Total sum = 33

**Approach:**  
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.  
2. Loop through each element of the array.  
3. Add each element to `sum`.  
4. Print the value of `sum`.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — We visit each element once.  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) — Only one extra variable `sum` is used.
